# Moves

You get away with a quiet rest. You are not disturbed although everyone except Zemthur seems to get the same visions of Karavakos.

Zemthur, however, is troubled by dreams of hairy creatures tearing him apart. Zemthur, you are reminded that when Splug turned up, he was babbling about being ripped apart.

Nevertheless, you get your rest and may activate the long rest on your character sheets. Those of you with spells may make any spell selection changes you wish.

You also each gain 6,688 experience points for defeating the hags, the trash beast, and the creatures in the bridge room, and taking their loot.

Brutus gains 1,400 experience points, but that's not enough to take him to the next level just yet, so you will need to apply another animal friendship spell over him.

How would you like to proceed: you can go back through the bridge room and take a the route north over the bridge, or take the other exit at the western end of the northern wall in this room, or something else?
